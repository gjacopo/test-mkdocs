The data used for the task-at-hand is the \"Carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) emissions from the burning of fossil fuels for energy and cement production\" dataset found in here and there . Outlier detection Time series data often undergo sudden changes that alter the dynamics of the data transitory or permanently. These changes are typically non systematic and cannot be captured by standard time series models. That's why they are known as exogenous or outlier effects. Detecting outliers is important because they have an impact on the selection of the model, the estimation of parameters and, consequently, on forecasts. Following the approach described in Chen & Liu (see references ), an automatic procedure for detection of outliers in time series is implemented in the package tsoutliers . The procedure may in turn be run along with the automatic ARIMA model selection strategy available in the package forecast . The function tso is the main interface for the automatic procedure. The functions locate.outliers.oloop and remove.outliers implement respectively the first and second stages of the procedure. In practice, the user may stick to use the function tso . Although the purpose of the package is to provide an automatic procedure, the implementation allows the user to do a manual inspection of each step of the procedure. Thus, the package is also useful to track the behaviour of the procedure and come up with ideas for possible improvements or enhancements. The functions locate.outliers.oloop and remove.outliers implement the major steps of the procedure. tso is the main interface to the automatic procedure. All the options at any stage of the procedure can be defined through the arguments passed to tso. Despite the user may stick to use the function tso, other functions called by this main interface are exported in the namespace of the package. They are helpful for debugging and allow the interested user to more easily track each step of the procedure. Information supplemental to these help pages is given in the document that is provided with the package (\"tsoutliers/inst/doc/\" in the source files, see also references ). Dataset information Human emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases \u2013 are a primary driver of climate change \u2013 and present one of the world's most pressing challenges. This link between global temperatures and greenhouse gas concentrations \u2013 especially CO2 \u2013 has been true throughout Earth's history. To set the scene, let\u2019s look at how the planet has warmed. In the chart we see the global average temperature relative to the average of the period between 1961 and 1990. The red line represents the average annual temperature trend through time, with upper and lower confidence intervals shown in light grey. We see that over the last few decades, global temperatures have risen sharply \u2014 to approximately 0.7\u2103 higher than our 1961-1990 baseline. When extended back to 1850, we see that temperatures then were a further 0.4\u2103 colder than they were in our baseline. Overall, this would amount to an average temperature rise of 1.1\u2103. Because there are small year-to-year fluctuations in temperature, the specific temperature increase depends on what year we assume to be 're-industrial' and the end year we are measuring from. But overall, this temperature rise is in the range of 1 to 1.2\u2103. Implementation The architecture of the workflow is depicted below: You can download the workflow from here ( TO BE ADDED ). User Story The country code and the starting year is inserted by the user using a KNIME component. Data is filtered according to the preferences of the user and the CO2 emission column is sent to R code in order for the tso function to execute, plot the anomalies and extract the indices of the outliers. Since tso starts the numbering from 1 and the original data have other indices, we ask KNIME to create a new \"RowID\" , we uniform the row id code for the original and the anomalous data and using the inner join node we extract the year that corresponds to all anomalies.
